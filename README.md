# nfl_nba_projections

Based on my 2018 IT452: Advanced Web and Internet Systems project. Project an NFL/NBA career based on user-entered biometrics and combine statistics. Results are for fun and are tongue-in-cheek; the data is skewed towards... professional athletes.

Doing NFL projections first.
