# nfl_nba_career_projections

Based on my 2018 IT452: Advanced Web and Internet Systems project.

- Link to pro football/basketball reference scraping repo, use that for data
- Allow users to input their combine "stats", personal data (height, weight, position, etc.)
- Project their career stats, season-by-season stats
    - Option to use a simple linreg projection or a NN
- Use KNN for player comps (combine and career comps)
- Can project draft position too
- Allow option to specify how many seasons they want to play, or use predicted seasons value
